Example implementations of artificial neural networks

## Hailed a the most powerful type of machine learning, Deep Learning is pretty gnarly. It canbe applied to a broad range of problems, like:
+ Regression and Classification Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
+ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), used in Computer Vision
+ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), used in Time Series Analysis
+ Feature extraction with Self-Organizing Maps
+ Recommendation systems with Deep Boltzmann Machines and Auto-Encoders
## In this repository, we will scratch the surface with:
+ ANN applied to solving a business problem
+ CNN applied to a computer vision task
